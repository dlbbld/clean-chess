 * A single lexical unit produced by a PGN tokenizer. The {@code text} field carries the logical payload — for tag

 * Structural tokens like {@link PgnTokenType#TAG_BRACKET_OPEN} or {@link PgnTokenType#NEWLINE} carry the literal text
 * of the character(s) consumed.
 *
 * <p>
 * Line and column are one-based and refer to the first character of the token in the source.
