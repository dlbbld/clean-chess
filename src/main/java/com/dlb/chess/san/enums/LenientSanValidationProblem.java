/**
 * Typed diagnostic codes emitted by the lenient SAN parser when it accepts an input that the strict parser rejects.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each code names a specific, individually-detectable deviation from canonical SAN. A single move can carry multiple
 * forgiven items (e.g. {@code nbxd7+} when actually mate triggers {@link #LOWERCASE_PIECE_LETTER},
 * {@link #OVERSPECIFIED_FILE_DISAMBIGUATION}, and {@link #WRONG_CHECK_SUFFIX_FOR_CHECKMATE} simultaneously). The
 * lenient parser surfaces every applicable code; consumers decide whether to silently accept or warn.
 *
 * <p>
 * Codes are grouped by category. The grouping has no runtime meaning — it is for human readability only.
