/**
 * Rook attacks via classical ray loops. {@link #attacks(int, long)} returns the bitboard of squares a rook on
 * {@code squareOrdinal} attacks given an {@code occupied}-mask of all pieces on the board. Each of the four
 * orthogonal rays (N, S, E, W) accumulates target bits until the ray falls off the edge or hits an occupied square
 * (the blocker bit is included before stopping) — matching the existing reference's "isAllowOwnPiece = true" attack
 * semantics.
 *
 * <p>
 * Classical ray loops are the chosen implementation here; magic-bitboard acceleration is deferred to the switchover
 * release.
