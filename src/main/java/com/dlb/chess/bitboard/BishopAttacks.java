/**
 * Bishop attacks via classical ray loops. {@link #attacks(int, long)} returns the bitboard of squares a bishop on
 * {@code squareOrdinal} attacks given an {@code occupied}-mask of all pieces on the board. The result includes every
 * empty square along each of the four diagonals plus the first blocker in that direction (regardless of colour) —
 * matching the existing reference's "isAllowOwnPiece = true" semantics for attacked squares (own pieces are
 * defended).
 *
 * <p>
 * Classical ray loops are deliberately the choice here; magic-bitboard acceleration is deferred to the switchover
 * release where it actually earns its keep on the hot path. The shape of this API ({@code int sq, long occupied})
 * matches what magics would slot into.
