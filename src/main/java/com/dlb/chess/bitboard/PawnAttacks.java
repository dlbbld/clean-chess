/**
 * Precomputed pawn-attack tables, one {@code long[64]} per side. {@link #attacks(Square, Side)} returns the diagonal
 * capture squares a pawn of the given side would reach from the given from-square — the <em>geometric</em> pattern,
 * defined for all 64 from-squares (including rank 1 and rank 8). Off-board target ranks return {@code 0L}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is deliberately geometric, not chess-legality-restricted. The reference {@code PawnDiagonalSquares} returns
 * an empty set for from-squares on rank 1 / rank 8 ("pawns only exist on ranks 2-7"), and that convention is the
 * right one for forward queries — real pawn bitboards never have bits on those ranks anyway. But the bitboard layer
 * also uses the reverse-attack identity in {@code BitboardPosition.attackersTo}: white pawns attacking a target X are
 * the squares returned by {@code PawnAttacks.attacks(X, BLACK)}. That query is well-defined for target X on
 * <em>any</em> rank, including the back ranks where promotions resolve. Hence the geometric pattern.
 *
 * <p>
 * For ranks 2-7 the bitboard table agrees bit-exact with {@code PawnDiagonalSquares}; ranks 1 and 8 are
 * intentionally non-empty here and the differential test below restricts the direct comparison accordingly.
