/**
 * FEN (Forsyth–Edwards Notation) parsing, validation, and generation. Three parser entry points across the
 * strict-vs-lenient (syntactic) and raw-vs-advanced (semantic) axes — see {@code specification.md} §3.3.3 for the
 * contract table.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.dlb.chess.fen.FenParserRaw} — basic structural parsing. One regex: six non-empty
 * space-separated fields. No semantic interpretation.</li>
 * <li>{@link com.dlb.chess.fen.FenParserAdvanced} — basic parsing plus advanced structural and rule-consistency
 * validation. Beyond field syntax it enforces:
 * <ul>
 * <li>exactly one king per side; pawn count &lt;= 8 per side; counts of non-pawn pieces beyond the starting set are
 * accounted for by missing pawns (promotion-consistency)</li>
 * <li>no pawns on rank 1 or rank 8</li>
 * <li>the side <em>not</em> to move is not in check (otherwise the last move would have been illegal)</li>
 * <li>castling rights consistent with king and rook static positions</li>
 * <li>en-passant target square consistent with the side to move and the adjacent pawn structure</li>
 * <li>halfmove clock not above the 75-move-rule threshold of 150 — a clock of exactly 150 is the legal terminal moment
 * and is accepted; only values strictly above 150 are rejected</li>
 * <li>halfmove clock consistent with the fullmove number — {@code halfMoveClock <= 2 * (fullMoveNumber - 1) +
 * (havingMove == BLACK ? 1 : 0)}; a FEN like {@code ... 15 1} (15 halfmoves on move 1) is physically impossible</li>
 * <li>fullmove number in the supported range</li>
 * </ul>
 * This is the variant {@link com.dlb.chess.board.Board#Board(String)} uses. It does not prove full game reachability —
 * a position passing these checks may still be unreachable from the initial position through any legal sequence;
 * structural and rule-consistency plausibility is the bar.</li>
 * <li>{@link com.dlb.chess.fen.LenientFenParser} — purely syntactic-tolerance pre-pass. Normalises whitespace,
 * casing, missing trailing counters, non-canonical castling order, non-ASCII dashes, and trailing garbage; also
 * recovers from the strict halfmove-clock-vs-fullmove-number inconsistency by auto-correcting the fullmove number
 * up to the minimum consistent value. After normalisation, delegates to {@code FenParserAdvanced} — strict
 * semantic invariants are unchanged. Every transform that fires surfaces as a typed
 * {@link com.dlb.chess.fen.ForgivenFenItem} on the {@link com.dlb.chess.fen.LenientFenParserValidationResult}.
 * Reached from {@link com.dlb.chess.board.Board#fromFenLenient(String)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link com.dlb.chess.fen.model.Fen} record is the parsed result — a value object carrying the static position,
 * side to move, castling rights, en-passant capture target square, halfmove clock, and fullmove number. FEN string
 * generation is via {@link com.dlb.chess.fen.FenBoard} from a {@link com.dlb.chess.board.Board}.
