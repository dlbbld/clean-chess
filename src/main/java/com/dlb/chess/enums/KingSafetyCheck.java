// is a movement question for the king (handled by analyzeMovement via KING_CAPTURES_GUARDED_PIECE
// and KING_MOVES_TO_ATTACKED_EMPTY_SQUARE). The was-in-check vs not-in-check distinction is
// only meaningful for non-king pieces, where it tracks two different mechanics (failure to
// interpose-or-capture vs discovery-pin), so the king-* failure values are not part of this enum.
