/**
 * The position-equivalence record used for in-game threefold-repetition equality and as the

 * <p>
 * The {@code enPassantCaptureTargetSquare} component is <strong>normalized</strong>: it holds the e.p. target square
 * only when an opposing pawn can <em>actually</em> capture there (king-safety considered); otherwise it is
 * {@link Square#NONE}. This matches the FIDE rule for position identity (a pawn that "could have been captured en
 * passant"). The raw FEN-spec e.p. target square (which is reported after any pawn double-step regardless of
 * capturability) lives on {@code Board} separately and is used for FEN export.
