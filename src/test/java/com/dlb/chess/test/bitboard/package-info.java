 * Differential tests asserting that {@link com.dlb.chess.bitboard.BitboardPosition} agrees bit-exact with

 * <p>
 * Tests under this package iterate the corpus via
 * {@link com.dlb.chess.test.pgn.setup.PgnTestCaseCatalog#getTestList} and run both representations through the
 * primitive under test, asserting agreement. Pure-unit-shaped bitboard tests (no corpus walk) live alongside their
 * subject under {@code com.dlb.chess.bitboard.*} instead.
