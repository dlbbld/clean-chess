/**
 * Test-only BFS oracle for the pawn-wall classifier.
 *
 * <p>
 * The production {@link PawnWallGeometricVerdict} predicate uses a geometric chain check. This oracle is the second opinion: a
 * king-walk BFS asking whether the side's king can reach the opposing king's square through passable squares — i.e.
 * whether the wall is a genuine separator between the two kings.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Passable squares</b>: empty squares; squares occupied by same-side non-pawn pieces (they can move out of the
 * way in a future move, opponent cooperating); squares occupied by undefended opposing pawns (the king captures them
 * and continues from the captured square); squares occupied by opposing non-pawn pieces (king captures). The
 * opposing king's square is treated as the BFS target — if the king's reach extends to it, the wall isn't a
 * separator.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Impassable squares</b>: squares occupied by same-side pawns (locked in a wall configuration); squares attacked
 * by any opposing pawn still on the board. The "attacked" check covers both empty attacked squares (king can't
 * enter check) and opposing pawns defended by another opposing pawn (the defender's attack also hits the defended
 * pawn's square — capture would be re-captured).
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Dynamic capture model</b>: the oracle iterates to a fixed point. Each round computes opposing-pawn attacks
 * from the <em>remaining</em> opposing pawns (after previous captures), then BFS-expands the king's reach. Any
 * undefended opposing pawn within reach is captured (removed from the remaining set) and a new round runs with
 * updated attacks. The process terminates when a round produces no new captures. This avoids the conservative
 * under-approximation of a single-pass static BFS, which would leave squares attacked by an already-captured pawn
 * marked impassable forever.
 *
 * <p>
 * See {@code pawn-wall-soundness.md} for the full design and the asymmetric agreement contract
 * ({@code geometric_YES ⟹ BFS_YES}).
