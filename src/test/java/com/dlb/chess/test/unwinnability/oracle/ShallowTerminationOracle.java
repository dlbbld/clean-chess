/**
 * Test-only oracle answering one question: in a depth-3 half-move tree from the given position, is there any path that
 * checkmates the loser (for {@code WINNABLE}), or do every single path resolve to a draw or self-loss (for
 * {@code UNWINNABLE})? If neither, the verdict is {@code UNKNOWN}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The search is cooperative — both sides are allowed to play any legal move. A single WIN-leaf anywhere in the 3-ply
 * tree is enough to conclude {@code WINNABLE} for the side that delivered the mate.
 *
 * <p>
 * "Drawing terminations" covered here: stalemate, fivefold repetition, seventy-five-move rule, dead-position
 * insufficient material, dead-position-by-CHA-quick, and one-sided insufficient material (when the side-to-evaluate is
 * the side that lacks the material).
 *
 * <p>
 * This oracle deliberately does <em>not</em> walk the forced unique-move chain — that's {@link ForcedLineOracle}'s job.
 * Neither does it know about pawn walls — that's the pawn-wall analyzer. {@link LimitedUnwinnabilityOracle} composes the
 * three.
