# Changelog

Releases from 3.3 onward. Earlier history is in git tags only.

The project is pre-major — releases are intermediate stabilization steps until the library reaches feature-maturity. Detail level here is deliberately modest; once the library hits major, this file will be more complete.

## [Unreleased]

Cleanup follow-through release. Documentation, naming, packaging, and design-consistency polish across the library.

### Breaking
- Package `com.dlb.chess.internationalization` renamed to `com.dlb.chess.messages`.
- Type prefix `Yawn*` renamed to `NoProgress*` (`YawnHalfMove` → `NoProgressHalfMove`, etc.) — matches FIDE / chess-community terminology.
- `ChessBoard.isGameEnd()` / `isGameDraw()` removed (were unused; carried a contested CHA-opt-in semantics).
- `InvalidMoveException` now extends `UsageException` (was extending `RuntimeException` directly).
- `Board.calculateLegalMove(...)` narrowed to package-private (was public-static; carried a contract no external caller could uphold).
- `Board.createPositionAfterMove(...)` moved to `StaticPositionUtility` (pure transformation, doesn't belong on the game class).

### Notable
- New `Reporter.calculateReportText(...)` returns the report as a string — for non-CLI consumers (web responses, file writes, GUIs).
- `log4j-core` dropped from runtime dependencies; `log4j2.xml` no longer ships in the JAR. Consumers no longer inherit the library's logging backend or configuration.
- `FileUtility.writeFile(...)` now propagates `IOException` (was silently swallowing).
- Javadoc on the public API; `mvn package` now produces a `-javadoc.jar`.
- JAR manifest carries `Implementation-Title` / `-Version` / `-Vendor`.
- Thread-safety contract documented in `specification.md` §2.4.
- New `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Internal
- All DGT-derived paid-work content removed.
- Test fixture tree reorganized (`pgn/cua` → `pgn/cha`, lichess subtree given hierarchical layout).
- `ConfigurationConstants.LOCALE` switched from `Locale.US` to `Locale.ROOT`.
- Test-only `GameStatusAnalysis`, `PROJECT_ROOT_FOLDER_PATH` relocated out of `src/main`.
- Many smaller items — see `tasks.md` "Current release — cleanup follow-through" for the per-task breakdown.
